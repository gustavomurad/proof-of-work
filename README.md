Simple demonstration in JS of how a PoW (Proof of Work) works

Nonce = "The nonce in a bitcoin block is a 32-bit (4-byte) field whose value is set so that the hash of the block will contain a run of leading zeros. The rest of the fields may not be changed, as they have a defined meaning." https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce

Proof of work = "A proof of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work system." https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work#Traditional_proof_of_work
